#HTML-Editor
    Edit a database and publish its contents to a simple HTML page via a GUI

##Motivation
I completed this project as part of the classwork at Cincy Code IT Java bootcamp.  It implements what I've learned about JDBC, MySQL, Swing, SAX and HTML.

##Project Set-Up
Before beginning, open and execute the SQL script in MySQL.  Add the MySQL JAR (found in lib/) to Java Build Path > Libraries in your project.

Run ui/Main.java to open the GUI.  

Select one of the radio buttons to select the topic for the page.  In the example script, the database is set up to display information about Experience or Food.

Choose which section to edit from the drop-down menu.  You can edit the paragraph text and bulleted list for each section.  

When your editing is complete, click the "HTML" button to generate a web page from the information saved in the database on that topic.  The page will be saved as "index.html" in the project folder.

For an example of a full webpage I created with the tool, please see <a href="https://github.com/sarawille/HTML-Editor/blob/master/ExperiencesExample.html">ExperienceExample.html</a>.
