</h4>
<p>We arrived at the eighth station hut to rest just 5 minutes before the 6 p.m. deadline for check-in. The hot meal, warm room and time to acclimatize were essentials, but I wish we had had a more peaceful sleep.  Starting at midnight, people woke to resume their hike to the summit. Outside, the eighth station was a hub of activity. A line of lights snaked up the mountain as people queued, headlamps shining, to reach the summit before sunrise.  We put on our warm gear and joined them around 1:30 a.m., under a sky full of stars.</p>

<ul>
<li>From Nagoya: 3 hr. drive, 1.5 hr. bus, 6.5 hr. hike up, 4.5 hr. hike down.</li>

<li>The summit is 3,776 m. (12,389 ft.) high.</li>

<li>A cup of noodles costs 800 yen at the summit.</li>

</ul>

<td rowspan="2"><h4><a href="https://sayonarasara.wordpress.com">Ajisai Tea Ceremony</a>
</h4>
<p>Tea ceremony class quickly became my favorite aspect of living in Japan.  I loved watching the seasons change through life in the tea room; the tea bowls, sweets, calligraphy and conversation evolved to be in harmony with the each distinctive time of year.  In the winter the water was boiled over a brazier inset into the tatmi mat floor; this warmed the room.  As spring came, we ate wagashi (Japanese tea sweets) that looked like plum blossoms with a few flakes of snow remaining on the petals.  When summer arrived, we made and served tea to hundreds of people in a picturesque garden tea house set above a cool pond.</p>

<ul>
<li>In a traditional ceremony, guests attend a 4 hour dinner before tea is served.</li>

<li>Two cups of tea are offered: usucha ("thin tea") and koicha ("thick tea").</li>

</ul>

</h4>
<p>We wove our way through narrow alleys in this old part of town until we found the right place – a tea house along the sakura-lined river. Shortly after we sat down, the owner presented us with hot tea and a Japanese sweet. The musician, wearing a colorful kinomo, played Japanese folk songs in front of a window overlooking the river and flowering trees. It was a quintessential Japanese moment.</p>

<li>From Nagoya: 2.5 hr. train.</li>

<td rowspan="2"><h4><a href="https://sayonarasara.wordpress.com">New Year in Okinawa</a>
</h4>
<p>On a beautiful and warm New Year’s Day, we trekked up a terribly steep mountain to take a pottery class. The Yachimun Studio was tucked away in a charming house with breathtaking farm and ocean views.  We were Ueshiro-san’s first customers of the new year, a special honor.  After making our own shisa, we washed the clay from our hands and took a few last pictures of the view before getting ready to leave, only to find Ueshiro-san return from the back with a tray of food.  He invited us to join him at the picnic table outside to eat donuts filled with Okinawan purple sweet potato (or beni imo in Japanese).  He gave each of us one to eat then, and one to take with us. </p>

<ul>
<li>From Nagoya: 2 hr. plane.</li>

</h4>
<p>After an early morning and traveling all day through chilly weather, we were thrilled to end the afternoon in a beautiful and traditional Japanese room, pampered by exceptional service. By the time we arrived, the open-air bath tub on the deck was already filled with steaming water and the electric tea pot was turned on, ready for the perfect cup of green tea. That evening, we were treated to a fabulous dinner in a private dining room downstairs. By the time we got back to our room, our suitcases had been moved aside, the futons were laid out, and the tea cups we used had been cleared from the table. It was a perfectly relaxing end to the day.</p>
